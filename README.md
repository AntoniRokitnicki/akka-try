~reStart

Your application starts up and SBT watches for changes in your source (or resource) files. If a change is detected SBT recompiles the required classes and sbt-revolver automatically restarts your application. When you press <ENTER> SBT leaves "triggered restart" and returns to the normal prompt keeping your application running.
